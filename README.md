# hello-world
Newbie's first experience with github

Damn, it took me forever to find the "pencil" to edit this.
The first step was to click on the icon that looks like a page with lines on it
Next, another window opened up with just the README.md file and there, on the RHS was the illusive pencil.
It's time to commit all of this ...
